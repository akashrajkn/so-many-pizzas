Gotta catch'em all! Redundant pizzas.

The pizza ontology (pizza.owl) contains a few inconsistencies and redundancies. The inconsistencies have been removed
in `consistent-pizza.owl` file. Many of the redundancies (not complete) that exists in this ontology have been removed.

Different types of redundancies have been introduced in `redundant-pizza.owl` file.
